Intro
=====

Hey everyone! I have no readers now...but maybe someday.

Like everyone else with a blog, I hope to share bits I learn about technology.


About Me
========

I'm a software developer who really loves low-level technology. I don't like to get too far from the metal, because that's where the knowledge is.
